                <p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more likeâ€¦suicide.</p>
                <p>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. </p>
                <p> There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
                <p> Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>

                <p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
                <p>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I call it luck.</p>
                <p>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
                <p>He is here. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
